If you have used C/C++ before, but not programmed a micro-controller before, that will almost certainly be sufficient background.

Note that due to the way floats are stored, arithmetic operations on floats may give unexpected results. For example, 6.0 / 3.0 may not be exactly equal to 2.0. Good practice when comparing floating point numbers is not to check whether they are exactly equal (with ==), but to check if the difference between them is below a threshold. \n",

    "- `b`?\n",
    "- `c`?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Undefined Behaviour:** The first question you might have is, what value does `c` begin with?  `c` is declared in `loop()` but not given an intial value.  The code continues to increment the value of `c` in the line ` c = c + 1`.  In the above code we assume that a declared variable initialises to a value of `0` - this is correct within Arduino, but is it true for all microcontrollers?  Making assumptions like this is bad practice.  It is much better to be explicit and to set initial values.  Try to be aware of when your code makes assumptions like this which may lead to undefined behaviour.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Persistence:** In the above example `a` is set as a global variable and so it will retain it's value throughout the execution of your program.  In contrast, `b` and `c` are local variables, which means they will only retain their value during the execution of their scope, `setup()` and `loop()` respectively.  Another way to think of this, is that the global scope will always be in execution, whilst local scopes are temporary.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, b is declared and initialised within `setup()` to a value of 0, and then deleted when `setup()` finishes, moving on to `loop()`.  In contrast, the global variable `a` is set to an initial value of 0 within `setup()`, and even though `setup()` closes, `a` will retain it's value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time `loop()` runs, variable `c` is newly created and has its value initialised to 0.  Therefore, the result of `c = c + 1` will equal 1 every time `loop()` is run.  In contrast, `a` is declared in the global scope and retains it's value.  This means that for 10 runs of `loop()`, `a` will hold the value 10.\n",
