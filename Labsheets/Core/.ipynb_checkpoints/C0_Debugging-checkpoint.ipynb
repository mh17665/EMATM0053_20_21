    "# Check Point 0: Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "Well done on getting to Check Point 0!\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point you should have:\n",
    "- used the default LED (LED_BUILT_IN, or pin 13), and potentially the TX RX LEDs.\n",
    "- used the buzzer to make beeping sounds\n",
    "- used the Serial functions print() and println(), and potentially Serial.read().\n",
    "\n",
    "These will become essential tools for you when working with your Romi.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A significant challenge when developing robotics is to understand what your robot is doing at any given moment.  Unlike standard software development (such as for a desktop computer), we usually develop software to transfer onto a separate robot (away from the computer we were working on).  This means it is not easy to get detailed information back from the robot.  Furthermore, we often expect modern autonomous robots to make their own decisions, and therefore they become less predictable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When we have an error in software, sometimes the software will work fine most of the time, but occasionally go wrong. These are the most difficult bugs, called **intermittent bugs**.  In these instances, we need to be able to observe the robot working and know when the failure occurs, and retrieve as much information as possible.  Therefore, software debugging in robotics usually involves much more than just the software!  It can be a very time-consuming process.\n",
    "\n",
    "A secret known to software developers is that most our time is spent hunting down and solving bugs.  As you gain experience, you'll realise it takes you less time to do so.  Don't be dismayed by the time you spend debugging - it is normal!  Stay calm, and see if you can apply the following information when diagnosing your problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Physical Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Robots are physical, unless you are working in simulation.  In reality, things come loose, wires come out, stuff gets wobbly, switches get moved, grit appears on the floor, batteries lose power, cables come unplugged, **etc**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Your first habit should be to always check your robot and environment.**  Has something changed in your environment?  Is everything on your robot plugged in correctly?  It is horrible to realise you have spent 2 days checking your code and made huge changes, only to realise the sensor wasn't plugged in.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Make a physical spot-check a habit - do it every time you use your robot - you'll then be much more confidence about whether your error or bug is based in software.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Brownouts\n",
    "\n",
    "Brownouts are quite particular to robotics (and embedded systems).\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the word `blackout` when the municipal electricity supply to city areas stops, and all the lights go out.  On microcontrollers, embedded systems and robotics, a **brownout** is when the supply voltage temporarily drops below what is needed to run the system.  This can happen if your motors are stalled (the sudden resistance draws a lot of power), if there is a short circuit, or if your batteries are low on power.  A brownout will cause your microcontroller to reset. \n",
    "\n",
    "When a brownout happens, you'll probably see your robot stop for a short moment, and then suddenly change its behaviour. What has actually happened is that your microcontroller reset, starting your code again from the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, it is good practice to:\n",
    "- play a beep or a sequence of beeps when the robot starts, from within setup()\n",
    "- Print a distinct line of text from within setup(), such as `***RESET***`\n",
    "- Use an LED to indicate status.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you see or hear these cues, you'll know your robot is suffering a reset problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Segmentation Faults\n",
    "\n",
    "Across these labsheets, we do not instruct you to use <a href=\"https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/variables/data-types/array/\">arrays</a> or pointers, which are common sources of Segmentation Fault errors.  Despite this, it is good to be aware of the challenge.  If you have developed software on a desktop computer, you may be familiar with a segmentation fault - when you attempted to run your compiled code and it crashed with the error printed back to you \"Segmentation Fault\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "A segmentation fault is generally a case where your code tried to access memory which was not available - such as accessing an element of an array that does not exist, or accessing an uninitialised class.  Segmentation faults can be **intermittent**, because there is a chance (especially on a microcontroller) that you access a random memory location that does not crash your system. If this happens, you might even see execution or logical errors (explained in the next section). \n",
    "\n",
    "Often in robotics we do not get a convenient error message sent back to us.  Therefore when a segmentation fault happens, your robot will reset and start again from the beginning of your code.  If you see your robot behaving irratically or reseting, this could be a cause, and you should follow the advice for **brownouts** above.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Errors & Bugs: Syntax, Execution, Logical\n",
    "\n",
    "Errors (and bugs) come in three flavours!  As you are working, try to keep track of what type of error and bug you are encountering:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors are the easiest to deal with.  Often your compiler (in our case, the Arduino IDE) will tell you that you've made a mistake somewhere.  Common syntax errors are:\n",
    "- missing a semi-colon `;` to finish a line of code\n",
    "- missing a curly-brace, either `{` or `}` to finish a code block\n",
    "- missing a parentheses, either `(` or `)` to finish a statement or call.\n",
    "- too many parentheses or curly-braces!\n",
    "- etc\n",
    "\n",
    "The Arduino IDE can then generate a lot of errors, because it isn't very intelligent.  It tries to compile all your code, despite the error, and gets everything confused.  Sometimes the IDE will take you to a seemingly random place in your code as the error because of this - as a rule, check the error list first.  As a good rule, scroll through the list of errors to the first error (the top most) in the list.  This will be closest to where you have made a mistake of syntax.  Enable line-numbering in the Arduino IDE preferences to make this easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good practice is to only make small changes.  In fact, I usually write a single line of code and then press CTRL+R as a habit to see if it compiles cleanly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another good rule is to try to be methodical when you write code.  For instance, if you are going to use an if() statement, write out the whole syntax first, then fill in the blanks:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "if( ) {  // Wrote out a blank if statement,\n",
    "         // no chance of forgetting a bracket!\n",
    "} else {\n",
    "    \n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent a real disaster later on (especially as we approach deadlines), keep versions of your code.  That way, when something all goes wrong, you can go back to the last good version.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Execution Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Execution Errors are the 2nd most difficult errors.  An execution error is where you have told your computer to do something, and when it does it, it crashes the system.  The syntax is fine but the execution result is a failure.  This is very often either a divide by 0 operation, or a segmenation fault.  These are also often intermittent - a divide by zero only happens with the right combination of circumstances (e.g., a common one is time elapsed is 0 milliseconds ).\n",
    "\n",
    "As a general rule, when writing out calculations, ask yourself if it is possible a zero could appear somewhere.  If using arrays, make sure you declare the array length and limit iterators with a `#define` maximum value in global scope.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In either case, begin an investigation with Serial.print().  Watch the value of key variables.  Add more statements to find the exact cause.  If you see NaN reported, this means \"not a number\", and it is another execution error from a calculation you'll need to fix.  Once you've found your bug or error, you should definitely consider removing all your print statements - skip ahead to Check Point 1 for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logical Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Logical Errors are perhaps the most difficult.  A logical error means that there is not a syntax error, and there is not an execution error.  In fact, you code is working **perfectly**.  However, the result or behaviour is wrong.  This is so difficult because when you read your code, it just looks correct.  However, the logic we have described to the computer is wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common examples of this are:\n",
    "- using `<` instead of `>`, or vice-versa.\n",
    "- using `=` within an if() statement, rather than `==`.\n",
    "- using `<` rather than `<=`, `>` rather than `>=`, or vice-versa.\n",
    "- typecasting errors, e.g., dividing an integer such that the result is always 0 (int's can't store fractions).\n",
    "- consecutive if() statements over-riding each other, jump ahead to **Check Point 1** for more information.\n",
    "- ...and really, the list can be endless.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solutions:\n",
    "- When something isn't working when it should, start to put in Serial.print() statements to follow the progress of your code.  Use meaningful text, so you know where you are.  \n",
    "- Rubber Duck (pair programming): Find a friend (or a duck), and explain each line of your code to them.  Do not summarise, be explicit.  This will help you to catch problems such as \n",
    "    - \"...less-than X - no wait! That should be greater-than!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Debugging with Serial\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Serial print functions is very useful.  However, try to be tidy with your Serial Print usage. Don't leave old print statements operating, because you'll simply build up too much information in the Serial Monitor window.  It is also the case that Serial is **Blocking** code, and can drastically effect the timing of your program - more information is in Check Point 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Better practice is to use Serial to diagnose problems as they occur.  Then, once you are confident that section of code is working and robust, you should comment out your Serial statements, and begin working on the next functionality of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graphing/Plotting Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be very convenient to view the changes to variables on a graph.  You can also plot more than one value, and the built in Plotter in the Arduino IDE will produce a coloured line for each variable.  To do this, at each time step (iteration) you must print each variable value separated by a comma, with the final value followed by a new line.  On the Serial Monitor, this might look something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "12, 44, 0, 22,\n",
    "14, 30, 2, 10,\n",
    "10, 32, 0, 12,\n",
    "(etc)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this in code, you can use the following template:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "\n",
    "// Some prior code above...\n",
    "\n",
    "Serial.print( variable_1 ); \n",
    "Serial.print( \", \" );       // separating comma\n",
    "Serial.print( variable_2 ); \n",
    "Serial.print( \", \" );       // separating comma\n",
    "Serial.print( variable_3 ); \n",
    "Serial.print( \", \" );       // separating comma\n",
    "Serial.print( variable_4 ); \n",
    "Serial.print( \",\\n\" );       // separating comma, newline\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above would print four comma-separated values, and produce a graph with four lines, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/paulodowd/EMATM0054_20_21/blob/master/images/multiplot.png?raw=true\" width=\"50%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above image, the legend indicates the colours blue, red, green, yellow, and these correspond to the order of printed variables (variable_1, variable_2, variable_3, variable_4).  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: If you include strings (text) or other print statements between the variables you'd like to plot, you will see strange behaviour on your Plotter.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n"
