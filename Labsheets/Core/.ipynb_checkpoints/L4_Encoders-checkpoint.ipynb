    "After Labsheet 3, it should be apparent that it would be useful to know how far your motors have rotated and how fast they rotating.  Using this information, we will be able to create a **closed loop** system.  The prior exercises controlled the robot without any sensor information - an **open loop** system.  In an open loop system, we have no way to know if the robot has done as we instructed it to.  A closed loop system uses sensor(s) to inform (feedback) the control of the system.\n",

    "## Understanding Quadrature Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "The <a href=\"https://www.pololu.com/product/3542\">rotary encoders on the Romi robot</a> use a magnet and two <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_effect_sensor\">Hall Effect sensors</a> to create Quadrature Encoding.  Quadrature encoding is a way of determining rotation by looking at the transition of at least two signals moving between 0 and 1.  It is very common to have just two signals, and these are referred to as **Channel A** and **Channel B**:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, the square waveforms are slightly shifted from one another, meaning that when one changes from high-to-low (or low-to-high), the other one will not.  The waveforms are  out of phase, out of synchrony.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**This means that one will always transition at a different time from the other.**  In fact, the reason these waves forms are out of phase is because of their physical placement on the printed circuit board - they will always detect a transition of the rotating magnet at a different time from one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "By noticing which waveform transitioned compared to the state of the other waveform, the direction of travel can be discerned.  This principle can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "**If:**\n",
    "- Channel A goes from LOW to HIGH\n",
    "- and Channel B is LOW\n",
    "- You are going CLOCKWISE!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Or if:**\n",
    "- Channel A goes from LOW to HIGH\n",
    "- and Channel B is HIGH\n",
    "- You are going COUNTER-CLOCKWISE!\n",
    "\n",
    "Every time we check the above rules, if there has been a state change, we can adjust our encoder count up or down, depending on the direction.  Counting the transitions of these signals gives an indiciation of how much a motor has rotated.  You can think of this as watching the black stripes passing, like in the animated image above.  In order to apply the above rules, our software code will need to remember the last state (the 'history') of channel A and B.  We need to make a new reading of Channel A and B, and check them against their previous values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Everytime the motor physically rotates, it will generate a new transition on the encoder.  Typically, encoders refer to this property as **Count Per Revolution (CPR)**, **Pulses Per Revolution (PPR)** or **Lines Per Revolution (LPR)**.  The higher the CPR, the more precisely  rotation can be determined. This is because we are essentially dividing a full rotation (360 degrees, or 2\\*PI radians) by the CPR.  One thing that will effect this, is whether the encoder is placed before or after any gearing on the motor.  It may be that a full rotation of the encoder is only a fraction of a full rotation of the wheel.  This is the case for your Romi.  Your Romi has a 120:1 gearbox.  \n",

The table layout below follows a convention of tracking the combination of binary transitions across columns right to left. \n",

    "# Introducing Pin Change Interrupts\n",

    "**Pin Change Interrupts** are a special piece of hardware.  Microcontrollers have many useful built-in peripherals.  A pin change interrupt watches a specific pin on the chip for a change of state (low to high, or high to low).  When it detects a change, it can be set to automatically run a piece of code.  The piece of code which runs automatically is called an **Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)**.  An ISR can be triggered to run by many peripherals, taking input internal or external to the microcontroller.  \n",

    "An ISR is called an interrupt because it will literally interrupt the sequence of your main code.  Most microcontrollers have only one central processing unit (CPU, often called a 'core').  Therefore, your code within _loop()_ runs on the CPU, but it will be paused to run an ISR instead.  You can think of an ISR as being a background task which only runs when it needs to.  If you want to play with ISR's more, have a look at the Advanced Labsheet 1.  **As a general rule, code within ISR's should be as short as possible in order to avoid taking up too much CPU time.**  If you are experimenting with an ISR and your robot starts to behave in a strange way, you may have made your ISR too big (or more seriously, have a bug within the ISR code).  Note that, using ISR's means the execution of your code is no longer deterministic - the compiler cannot predict when an ISR will activate, and neither can you.  For example, can we know with 100% certainty when a wheel and motor will rotate, causing an encoder pin transition?\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, a Pin Change Interrupt is perfect for watching the state of our encoders.  Every time a wheel is rotated, we want to count the pulses from the encoder.  If we were to **poll** the encoders (that means, just check them as quickly as we can), then there is a good chance we will miss some pulses because of other operations taking place in the general sequence of our main _loop()_ code.  We can consider catching encoder pulses to be a high priority, higher than our main program.  If we miss encoder pulses, we will loose track of our robots position.  Whether or not this is true generally depends a lot on the task and requirements you have for your robot.\n",
    "\n",
    "However there is a limitation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Only specific pins can be monitored by a Pin Change Interrupt.  The Romi has two encoders, each with two pins to watch.  This means for our Romi, we need to watch 4 pins in total.  The designers of Romi decided to use some electronics to reduce this down to 2 pins - using just one pin to register a change for both pins for an encoder.  They have achieved this by using an electronic XOR (eXclusive OR) logic gate across the A and B pins, one XOR for each encoder.  Recall that the signals for A and B are out of phase.  Therefore, by XOR'ing A with B, we can register a change to either A or B through just one pin (it will always be exclusively one or the other that changed).  This electronic XOR result is sent through the Pin Change Interupt pin, whilst the normal result for the other encoder pin can be read with a normal digitalRead() through another microcontroller pin.  By using an XOR operation to compare the two again in software, the true value of the XOR signal can be restored versus the normal state of the other pin.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**For now, you don't need to fully understand this operation - it is a matter of interest**.  If you want to fully understand it, I suggest you draw out a logic truth table for XOR, then some pin transitions, and apply XOR logic.  In any case, you'll notice the following section of code within our ISRs to perform this XOR and restore the A and B pin states.  It looks a little strange - **but don't worry, it is complete and you do not need to modify it:**\n",
