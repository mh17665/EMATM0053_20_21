    "We will explore the built in Arduino function `millis()` to allow us to imitate a task scheduling system for running blocks of code.  This is useful if we want to do multiple things at once.  For instance, we may wish to update our motor control every 0.5 seconds, whilst updating our line sensor every 0.1 seconds, and to make sure these happen independently.  It would be no good if our code had to stop and wait every 0.5 seconds - that would mean it could never check the sensors every 0.1 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `millis()` function reports the time passed in milliseconds since the arduino was powered up.  We can use this to decide to run a block of code once a period of time in milliseconds has elapsed.  If you wanted a smaller time interval, there is also a `micros()` function which operates in the same way we use `millis()`, but reports microseconds since power-up.\n",
    "\n",
    "For `millis()` to keep track of time, the arduino has some code running in the background by default.  Behind `millis()`, a peripheral device called a **timer** is independently tracking the passage of time, and running a piece of code called an **interrupt service routine (ISR)** which updates the count for `millis()` automatically.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the built in function millis() means that we do not have to get involved with using a **timer/ISR**.  After this worksheet, you may wish to look at the supplementary labsheet on Interrupts & Timers.  The supplementary labsheet isn't necessary to complete the coursework.  If you want to work with microcontrollers in the future it is worthwhile investigating.  \n",

    "# Exercise 1: Using millis() as a Watchdog Timer\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be useful to keep track of the passage of time to decide if the robot should change it's behaviour.  A good example is when the robot is trying to find the line, or when the robot has lost the line - when should it give up?  Generally we refer to this sort of mechanism as a watchdog timer. \n",
    "\n",
    "The arduino _millis()_ function provides how many milliseconds have passed since the arduino was turned on (a timestamp).  The Arduino is configured by default to alway count up in milliseconds as a background task.  How this actually works is that the Timer peripheral _timer0_ is configured to keep track of time for you by using an _interrupt service routine (ISR)_.   It is useful to remember that _timer0_ is always counting up for you in the background from the moment the power is switched on.\n",
    "\n",
    "_millis()_ provides the number of milliseconds elapsed in the format **_unsigned long_** (more info <a href=\"https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/variables/data-types/unsignedlong/\">here</a>).  This means the Arduino can count up to 4,294,967,295 milliseconds.  That is approximately 50 days.  After 50 days, it will reach the maximum value and begin counting from 0 again, which is called an **overflow**.  This means we can only use _millis()_ as a reliable mechanism for 50 days - it is not a perfect solution.  However, your Romi will probably run out of battery power before _millis()_ finished a complete count cycle.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We can use _millis()_ to keep track of how much time has passed by recording the millisecond count from one time to another - we will refer to these as **timestamps**.  Note that _millis()_ is relative time - how much time has passed, **not the actual time of day**.  We therefore compare two values reported by _millis()_ to work out how much time has passed.  \n",

    "In the above diagram, `timestamp` recorded a millis() count of 1200 (the green bar).  Time continued, and the system millis() eventually reports a count of 2300.  If we subtract millis() from `timestamp`, we get an elapsed count (time) of 1100ms.  We can monitor the elapsed time within an `if statement` to select what to do based against a criteria, such as `1000` (or another interval of time).
