    "If you are performing a calculation and your result is always 0 or `NaN`, it is highly likely that you have an issue with the **type** of your variable.  Remember that an `integer`, `long`, `char`, `byte` (etc) can only represent a whole number, whilst a `float` or a `double` can store fractional parts. Therefore, dividing two integers (or other similar type) will often result in a rounding error.   \n",
    "\n",
    "When we are writing calculations for the Arduino it is important to understand a general rule: \n",
    "- **read the operation from right-to-left**, excepting the normal mathematical rules.\n",

    "It is good practice to assume the compiler (or Arduino) is very stupid, and will make the worst choice for you.  Therefore, you should try to make sure you are always using the appropriate variable type.  If you have a good (smart) compiler which handles types well, lucky you!  But why take that risk?\n",

    "```C++\n",
    "  result = a / b;\n",

    "...because we declared `result` as a `float`.  However, if we annotate our types and re-read the line from right-to-left:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "  [float]result = [int]a / [int]b;\n",

In this case, the compiler assumes the type on the right-hand side is (`int`), and executes the operation as `int` in working memory, and only afterwards stores the result into a `float`.  So your `result` will always store a 0 (rounding error).\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform the above calculation a safer manner, the calculation can be broken into explicit steps, making use of <a href=\"https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Cast\">typecasting</a>, which also helps with the readability of your code:\n",
