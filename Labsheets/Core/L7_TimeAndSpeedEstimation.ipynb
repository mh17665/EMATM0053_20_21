    "# Labsheet 7: Time and Speed Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "This worksheet will build upon the previous Motors & Encoders labsheets.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Later exercises draw on Advanced Labsheet 1 Timers & Interrupts - you do not need to complete either the later exercises nor the Advanced Labsheets to complete Assessment 1.**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Note that, when we looked at Encoders previously, the ISR (Interupt Service Routine) code to count encoder steps had no correlation with time.  The ISR for the encoder automatically executed on the pin change, but we did not know when (in time) that this happened.  Therefore, we can know the distance by counting the encoder steps, but we need to know something about when they happened (time) to estimate speed.  In order to get speed, we need to know both the change in distance and the change in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this labsheet will will investigate correlating encoder counts with time.  From this, we can then determine the velocity of the wheel.  Remember that:\n",
    "- *velocity = distance / time *.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also important to remember that:\n",
    "- Our encoder counts have a relationship to the distance travelled by the wheel, or the angular position of the wheel.  \n",
    "- Either are a valid representation of velocity (mm/s, or radians/s).\n",
    "- You could also keep your code agnostic of units, instead using encoder_counts per second, and do a transformation to units later on in your program.  \n",
    "- When we control the robot (within this assessment), we don't really care exactly how fast we are going, we just want to maintain smooth and steady speed.\n",
    "- It is best practice to keep ISR code as short as possible (because they steal CPU time).  It is even possible for an ISR to interrupt itself if an ISR takes too long to execute.  Eventually, your microcontroller would run out of space on the program stack, and you'd observe your robot reset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three approaches we can take:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Implement a timestamp approach (using **micros()**) within the main _loop()_.  Remember that _loop()_ is called iteratively, and the encoder ISR will be operating in the background.  Therefore, we know that:\n",
    "   - The encoder count will change by an unknown quantity between _loop()_ execution.\n",
    "   - The elapsed time will change by an unknown quantity between _loop()_ execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Implement a timestamp approach (using **micros()**) **within the encoder ISR**.  We know that:\n",
    "   - The encoder ISR will always increment/decrement the encoder count by 1 because it activates on every single pin state change.  Therefore, the change in distance will always be the same.\n",
    "   - The time elapsed between the ISR execution will vary.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "3) Implement **Timer3** to monitor the encoder count.  We know that:\n",
    "   - Timer3 will be set up to run at a fixed time interval (1000hz, 0.001 seconds, for example), therefore the elapsed time will be fixed).\n",
    "   - The number of encoder counts will vary between Timer3 ISR execution.\n",
    "    \n",
    "These three methods come with complimentary advantages and disadvantages.  At this stage in your progression through the Unit, you should be achieving a level of profficiency where by you can experiment and discuss observations with your peers.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should also be able to decide which approach is sufficient for your solution.\n"
