    "# Exercise 1: Making Motors Move\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to a micro-controller, motors are typically high powered devices and require their own electronics to operate.  A device like an Arduino cannot normally power a motor directly.  Most microcontrollers will output 5volts at 25milliamps on a digital pin.  It is also the case that when we run a motor, the electronics can become unstable causing unpredictable computing performance.  On your Romi, you will likely see your robot reseting when the batteries get low and the motors are activated.  Therefore, motors are often kept isolated with their own electronics and power supplies.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately it is very convenient to buy modular pieces of electronics to drive a motor, normally referred to as **motor drivers**.  The Romi motors are DC motors. The motor drivers are built into the black circuit board of the Romi.  If you're interested, you might want to google <a href=\"https://lmgtfy.com/?q=h-bridge+circuit\">H-Bridge drivers</a>, which is the configuration of electronics ordinarily used to drive a motor in two directions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It has become very common to operate a DC Motor Driver with two signals:\n",
    "- Direction (DIR) - which way to turn.\n",
    "- Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) - how much power, related to speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two signals allow us to control the direction and the power sent to a motor.  The **motor driver** therefore has DIR and PWM as two inputs.  The DIR signal is digital, meaning high (5v) or low (0v), and will correspond to rotating the motor clockwise or counter-clockwise.  The motor driver PWM pin reads an analog voltage received - therefore a voltage in the range of 0v and 5v - and proportionally drives power to the motor.  It is **not safe** to assume the relationship between the PWM signal and the motor speed is linear - you should always check the datasheet and experiment with your motors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, in order to drive your motor, you need to:\n",
    "- Set the DIR pin to determine the direction of motion.\n",
    "- Set the PWM pin to an appropriate voltage level to determine the speed of rotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "An Arduino (or other microcontroller) can generate a PWM signal as an output on a digital pin.  This is used to synthesise an approximation to an analog signal.  With Arduino, a function called _analogWrite()_ performs this operation.  Writing a value of 255 creates a constant high signal (5v), whilst writing a 0 creates a constant low signal (0v).  Values between 0 and 255 generate square waveforms with a ratio of _mark_ to _space_ (high, low), which can be thought of as _averaging_ out to a voltage between 0v and 5v when received by another device.  The more time the square waveform is high, the closer the voltage is to 5v, and vice-versa.\n",

    "<a href=\"https://www.arduino.cc/en/uploads/Tutorial/pwm.gif\"><img src=\"https://www.arduino.cc/en/uploads/Tutorial/pwm.gif\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that this use of PWM and DIR is common to motor drivers such as the <a href=\"https://www.active-robots.com/controllers/motor/dc-motor-controllers/pololu-g2-high-power-motor-driver-18v25.html\"> Pololu G2</a> or the <a href=\"https://coolcomponents.co.uk/products/drv8835-dual-motor-driver-shield-for-arduino\">DRV8835 Dual Motor Driver Shield for Arduino</a>.  Sometimes more advanced boards will have extra pins for motor braking, current control and current sensing.  Other motor drivers have advanced communication protocols like I2C, TWI or SPI.\n",
