We can think of a class as way of containing these same techniques within itself.\n",

When a class is created well it can be used multiple times, providing 'copies' of the same code for different problems.  You can almost think of a class as a \"mini-program\", however you must make calls to it and control its execution from your main program.\n",

    "```C++\n",
    "myClassName_c copy1;\n",

We are asking the Arduino to create a space in memory to store all of the code contained within our class (`myClassName_c`), and that we wish to access it via the names `copy1`, `copy2` and `copy3`.  Because we are giving them 3 different names, we are creating 3 different spaces each with the same format.\n",

However you will notice that if you use a `typedef`, `struct`, `union` or `class` within Arduino, it doesn't receive any syntax highlighting (it is not coloured like a variable type for you).  **In order to make your code easier to debug, it is useful to place a `_c` after a class typename to remind yourself that you are looking at and working with a class.  This small effort will save you a lot of time debugging.**  Similarly, you might use `_s` for a struct, a `_u` for union, a `_t` for typedef.  We do not cover unions, typedef, or struct on this course.\n",

    "### Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find a partially complete `class` for your line sensor on github.  It is recommended to download the code stub which has class templates created for you in seperate files. These should appear as tabs within the Arduino IDE.\n",
    "- Add a new function to the lineSensor_c class to return the result of an `analogRead()`\n",
    "- Declare 3 instances of the lineSensor_c class in your main code. \n",
    "    - Make sure that each instance receives a different pin for each of the small IR detectors on the line sensor (`A4`, `A3`, `A2`).\n",
    "    - Use `Serial.print()` within `loop()` to inspect the values reported by your line sensor class.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calibrating for Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "You should notice that when your line sensor is over white paper, the 3 IR detectors report slightly different values.  In theory, we want the left, centre and right IR detectors to influence the turning behaviour of the robot equally, left to right.  Therefore, any bias might cause the robot to drift one way or the other.  We can remove this bias to make the sensor easier to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write a calibration routine for the IR sensor.  \n",
    "    - Your calibration routine should compensate for any bias in each individual sensor signal.\n",
    "    - You'll need to create variables within the class to store your bias reading.\n",
    "    - The simplest way to calibrate is to construct a mean (average) value whilst the IR detector is over a white surface.  When we then take later readings, we can subtract this average (the bias) from our reading. \n",
    "    - **Hint:** Be careful of variable over flow.  If you store something like 100 sensor readings into a float it may overflow.  It can be better to store, on each iteration, the current reading divided by the total number of samples - e.g., accumulating the fractional values\n",
    "    - The way floating point numbers are stored computationally is really clever and interesting, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/PZRI1IfStY0\">check out this video!</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Hint:** Be careful of type conversion. If you store sensor readings into an int, a division operator or multiplication by a fraction may return 0.\n",
    "    - **Hint:** In order for our calibration routine to run correctly, the Romi should remain stay with all sensors on a white surface. It's a good idea to add a beep to the end of your calibration routine so you know when your calibration is complete.\n",
    "- Write and test a new function which returns the `analogRead()` value minus your calibrated bias value.  A good name would be readCalibrated().\n",
    "- Adjust your main code so that:\n",
    "    - When your robot powers up, `setup()` calls the calibrate routine for each of your 3 IR detectors on the line sensor.\n",
    "    - Your Romi then reports via Serial the calibrated values from your sensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Going further (optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are observant, you may notice that once you have completed your calibration, your Romi may later report negative values from the sensor, even though we would expect calibration to fix the 'white surface' value to 0.  This is largely due to changes in the environment.  As your robot travels:\n",
    "- the ambient light will change, effecting the sensor reading.\n",
    "- the Romi chassis will move, altering the distance to the surface.\n",
    "- the stablity of the power supply for your Romi may vary, effecting readings.\n",
    "\n",
    "A technique to mitigate such factors may be to continuously calibrate the sensor during the operation of you Romi, but this requires careful consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above task, we also only corrected for bias over a white surface.  There are other factors.  For instance:\n",
    " - the minimum value reported by the sensor.\n",
    " - the maximum value reported by the sensor.\n",
    " - the slope of the line between minimum and maximum.\n",
    " - the linearity of the reponse.\n",
    " \n",

    "# Exercise 3: Bang-Bang controller\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will implement a simple Bang-Bang controller to follow a line. A Bang-Bang controller selects from a limited range of control outputs (Usually two, but in this case three). The control logic (the decision the robot will make) is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Line under sensor 1 -> Turn Right\n",
    "- Line under sensor 2 -> Go Straight\n",
    "- Line under sensor 3 -> Turn left\n",
    "\n",
    "The output from an individual reflectance sensor will be a voltage between 0 and $V_{in}$. This will be read by the Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) in the Romi's Atmel 32u4 and converted to an integer between 0 and 1023. We must convert these numbers into something which is meaningful to us. The simplest way to do this is to convert the output to a binary signal (telling us whether a particular sensor is over a line or not) by applying a threshold. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 1:\n",
    "- Determine an appropriate threshold for this signal. \n",
    "- Start by repeatedly printing the (calibrated) value of the sensor and see how it changes as you move the sensor on and off a line. \n",
    "- Adapt your code to print to the Serial port whenever a sensor is over a line. \n",

    "\n",
    "**Hint:** Be aware that high motor power values will cause your robot to move very quickly - and so the sensor may completely skip over the line before it can take a reading.  Therefore, start with low power values for your motors, and then increase these towards a more desirable performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** You will need to make a few decisions when implementing this approach. You will need a threshold for evaluating which sensor the line is under, and also decide appropriate motor power values for forward and turning.

A common issue is that a tight corner may need the robot to stop moving fowards and instead turn on the spot.  A confidence measure allows a missed tight corner to be recognised without other perceptual cues (e.g., the tight corner is not \"mapped\" or \"seen\").  Arguably, you could program your Romi to move very slowly for the entire course - however this is grossly inefficient.  Without a confidence measure, your robot might jitter on every occasion it momentarily comes off the line (i.e. not a corner).  With a confidence measure, smooth curves can be traversed with foward momentum in addition to a turning behaviour.  By including this information, your robot can afford to lose the line momentarily, and you should observe overall smoother behaviour.  \n",

We could think of this as creating a robot which quickly loses confidence (a nervous robot?).

There is no reason not to use a combination of additive and multiplicative, if it suits your task.  \n"
