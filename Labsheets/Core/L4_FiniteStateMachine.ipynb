    "\n",
    "At this stage, you are probably encountering a need to transition between different behaviours for your robot (e.g., \"drive straight\", \"join line\", \"follow line\").  The general layout and design of your code can quite messy and complicated.  This is quite normal in a development cycle, but it can be a major cause of time spent solving bugs.  It is good practice to consolidate your code and to reduce functional repetition.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This labsheet will cover how to organise different behaviours for your robot, and to do so in a consistent manner.  It is then much easier to enable or disable behaviours, or to change the mechanisms to start or end behaviours. \n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, you should have gained experience with:\n",
    "- The Arduino code structure of a **setup()** and **loop()**. \n",
    "- Variables at **global** and **local** scope.  \n",
    "- Utilising iterating code blocks, such as **for( ) {}** or **while() {}**\n",
    "- Utilising selecting code blocks, such as **if() {}** \n",
    "- Sending output signals to motors, buzzer and LEDs.\n",
    "- Writing your own **functions**.\n",
    "- Writing or expanding a **class**.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also have programmed your robot to:\n",
    "- Drive in a straight line, or turn a specified angle\n",
    "- Detect and follow a line with the line sensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**It is strongly recommended that before you attempt this worksheet, you go back and tidy up your code.  You may even want to create some clean and simple programs for sub-tasks or sub-behaviours (e.g., \"Drive straight\", \"follow line\").  It will then be easier to add these parts to the exercises in this labsheet.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For this labsheet it can also help to do some sketching on paper to help organise the complexity of the task. \n"

    "## Finite State Machines\n",
    "\n",
    "<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine\">Wikipedia</a> defines a Finite State Machine (FSM) as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- _\"A finite-state machine (FSM) ... is a mathematical model of computation. It is an abstract machine that can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time. The FSM can change from one state to another in response to some external inputs; the change from one state to another is called a transition. An FSM is defined by a list of its states, its initial state, and the conditions for each transition.\"_\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example, also from Wikipedia, will also help us to understand how to implement a FSM for our Romi.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a simple mechanism that can be modeled by a state machine is a turnstile. \n",
    "\n",
    "A turnstile, used to control access to subways and amusement park rides, is a gate with three rotating arms at waist height, one across the entryway. Initially the arms are locked, blocking the entry, preventing patrons from passing through. Depositing a coin or token in a slot on the turnstile unlocks the arms, allowing a single customer to push through. After the customer passes through, the arms are locked again until another coin is inserted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considered as a state machine, the turnstile has **two possible states: Locked and Unlocked**. There are **two possible inputs that affect its state: putting a coin in the slot (coin) and pushing the arm (push)**. In the locked state, pushing on the arm has no effect; no matter how many times the input push is given, it stays in the locked state. Putting a coin in – that is, giving the machine a coin input – shifts the state from Locked to Unlocked. In the unlocked state, putting additional coins in has no effect; that is, giving additional coin inputs does not change the state. However, a customer pushing through the arms, giving a push input, shifts the state back to Locked.\n",
    "\n",
    "The turnstile state machine can be represented by a state transition table, showing for each possible state, the transitions between them (based upon the inputs given to the machine) and the outputs resulting from each input:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/paulodowd/EMATM0054_20_21/blob/master/images/Turnstile_state_machine_colored.png?raw=true\"></br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above diagram we can see that:\n",
    "- The system starts at the Black dot, and therefore immediately moves to an **initial state** of **locked**\n",
    "- Sensing **push** while **locked** keeps the system in state **locked**.\n",
    "- Sensing a **coin** while in **locked** transitions to state **unlocked**.\n",
    "- Sensing a **coin** while in **unlocked** keeps the system in state **unlocked**.\n",
    "- Sensing **push** while in **unlocked** transitions the state to **locked**.\n",
    "- The FSM will never go to an undetermined state.\n",

    "# Developing a FSM \n",
    "\n",
    "Building a FSM can become very complicated.  It is best to get something simple working first. To start with, we will design a FSM to get our robot to drive forward from the starting box on the map, and then stop when it finds the line.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When designing an FSM, we need to step away from our human understanding of how the robot should behave.  We need to decompose the desired behaviour into smaller parts which rely only on the information available to the robot.  It may even help to imagine being the Romi robot with the sensors it has.  We need to make sure we catch any assumptions about the robot, any ambiguity, and any potentially ambiguous circumstances.  For example, what should your robot do as soon as you turn it on?  The robot is fundamentally stupid, and we need to embody our intelligence with code. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, it would be useful if, when we turn on the robot, it makes sure all motors are off so it doesn't run away, and it beeped every second for 5 seconds total.  This behaviour would let us know that it had turned on correctly, and it would give us enough time to put the robot down on to the course.  This short behaviour would be our **initial state**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will work on moving between **3 states**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An **initial** state: the robot will beep 5 times with a total delay of 5 seconds so that you know your robot is active and you can place your robot down onto the course.  \n",
    "2. A **driving forwards** state, to drive out of the CW1 course starting box.  \n",
    "3. A **found line** state, to get the robot to stop when it finds the line, and it will beep for 1 second.\n",
    "\n",
    "And then we can describe our transitions loosely as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We want out FSM to stay in **initial** state for 5 beeps (time, 5 seconds). \n",
    "- We want our FSM to go from **initial** state to **driving forwards** state.  \n",
    "- Once in **driving forwards** state, we want it to keep returning to this state until a line is detected.\n",
    "- If a line is detected, the FSM will move into **found line** state, and beep for 1 second.  The code will then return to **found line**, even if taken away from the line, preventing Romi from doing anything more (just for this exercise).\n",
