    "This supplementary labsheet introduces the IMU (accelerometer, gyro) and Magnetometer.  These are advanced devices for your Romi.  They can be used to help track your heading, any rotation, and any knocks.  However, each of the devices has key advantages and disadvantages.  You should think carefully about how they can be used to compliment one-another, and in which applications they might prove to be useful.  These sensors can help to make your Romi more robust to environmental changes, such as wheel-slip or collisions - but not without significant development time to get them working and to verify them.\n",

    "Unlike the sensors we have seen so far, the IMU has a digital output. The sensors we have used so far (line sensor, IR distance sensor) output an analog voltage (which we read with analogRead()). The IMU, however, uses a digital communication protocol known as $i^2c$ to transmit the output as a digital signal. Fortunately for us, most of the complexities of dealing with this are taken care of by the LSM6 Library which we will use to interface with the IMU. \n",

    "\n",
    "Finally, in the main loop we repeatedly call `imu.read();`. This asks the IMU for the latest reading. We can access the accelerometer readings with `imu.a.axis`. For example, if we want the x-component of accelleration, we would write `imu.a.x`. \n",

    "You should see that when the Romi is placed flat on the ground, you get a reading in the Z direction of around 17000. How do we interpret this number? Unlike an analog voltage, the IMU outputs this number directly. In fact, as the IMU is a digital sensor, we change the sensitivity of the sensor to suit our application. If we look in the datasheet, we can find the following table:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/paulodowd/EMATM0054_20_21/blob/master/images/IMU_Conversion_factors.png?raw=true\">\n",
    "\n",
    "This table tells us the conversion factor for each sensitivity setting. For example, if we set the accellerometer to have a range of +/- 2g, then the least significant bit of the output is equal to 0.061 mg (g here refers to gravity, not grams). This means that if we multiply the output by 0.061, then we will get a measurement in units of mg. Similarly, for the gyroscope, if we use the default sensitivity (+/-245 mdps, mili degrees per second), we should multiply the readings by 8.75 to get a reading with units of mdps. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in the Sketch above, when we call the line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C++\n",
    " imu.enableDefault();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "we set the default sensitivity for these sensors (+/-2g for the accellerometer, and +/- 245 mpds for the gyroscope). If we want to, we can select a different sensitivity for each sensor. To do so, we again look in the datasheet.\n",

    "This table tells us the meaning of the bits in the linear sensor control register (CTRL1_XL). We can see that the four left most bits are used to control the output data rate, which we are not interested in here. The next two bits set the full-scale sensitivity. If we set these to 00, then we will have a sensitivity of +/-2g. If we want a greater range, we can do this by changing these values. For example, we could increase the range to +/- 4g by setting these bits to equal 01. Note that this increased range means we lose resolution (As the sensor can only output information to 16 bit precision). To actually change these values, we have to send the data with $i^2c$. To do this, we use the writeReg function. For example, we could change the accellerometer sensitivity to +/-4g by writing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C++\n",
    " imu.writeReg(LSM6::CTRL1_XL, 0b01011000); // 208 Hz, +/4 g\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we must remember that if we change the sensitivity, then the conversion factor will also change. In this case, we should now multiply our readings by 0.122 to get a unit of mg.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3> Task 2:</h3> Add a conversion factor for the accellerometer and gyroscope and verify that the units are approximately correct (You should see a reading of about 1000 from the accellerometer Z axis).\n",

Secondly, soft iron distortions are caused by materials which do not produce magnetic fields, but can change them. \n",

    "During your experimentation, you should have seen that although the low-pass filtered heading from the magnetometer is pretty reliable when the Romi is stationary, when it begins to move, the heading estimate from the magnetometer does not keep up with the movement (Because of this, another name for the filter above is the <i>lag</i> filter. This means that while we can trust the low-pass filter to give us a good estimate in the long term, on short time scales, it may be wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a better estimate of the Romi's heading, we need to combine the lag filter with a second source of information that is reliable over these short time scales. A simple way of doing this is with a complementary filter. To fully understand the details of a complementary filter, we would need to introduce frequency domain control design. Intuitively, we can think of a complementary filter as deciding which of two sources of information to trust. One sensor (the magnetometer) in our case is trusted on long time scales, while another (The gyroscope in this case) is trusted only in the short term. A simple way to implement a complementary filter is with:\n",

In this case, if the gyro_reading is small (i.e we are not rotating quickly), the heading would converge towards the output of the low pass filter we implemented in Exercise 3. However, if we do start to move quicky, then the gyro_reading will be integrated and added to the heading, allowing us to respond to quick changes as they are happening.\n",

We can use a similar idea to combine the information from our encoders with the information from the complementary filter. This should give us a heading estimate which is robust to things like wheel slip and collisions. \n",
