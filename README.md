## Unit Summary

The offical rubric for this unit of study can be found at <a href="https://www.bris.ac.uk/unit-programme-catalogue/UnitDetails.jsa?unitCode=EMATM0054">Unit Catalogue: EMATM0054</a>.

The aim of this unit is to give you a "complete" experience of running a scientific robotics experiment.  By the end of this unit, you will have written up a conference paper styled report, in which you present a study and results based on a robotic system.  To get to that point, this unit builds up your skill to program and understand a small mobile robot called Romi.  The lectures and labsheets will help to familiarise you with the interesting challenges of robotic systems.  This unit will:
- serve as an introduction to robotics.
- equip you with programming skills to develop microcontroller systems.
- develop your analytical skills.
- develop your communication skills.
- prepare you to present your own proposal, scientific argument, and credible results.

## Core Labsheets

As a guideline, previous students have averaged a sum total of 48 hours to cover the following core labsheet materials and assessment 1 (6 weeks x 8 hours, an appropriate portion of a 10 credit unit).  This year (2020-2021) we have provisioned for 6 weeks x 16 hours (an appropriate portion of a 20 credit unit), expecting various interuptions from the COVID-19 pandemic, and with appropriate adjustments to the specification. You may experience a small delay in receiving your kit, however, you should have ample time for focused study.  Assessment 2 takes place in the remaining 6 weeks of the unit.

These labsheets present exercises for you to develop skill with the robotic system "Romi".  The Supplementary Labsheets are not necessary to complete Assessment 1 to a high standard.  These labsheets provide all of the core "ingredients" for your robotic system - but ultimately it is up to you to solve the final architecture of autonomous behaviour to successfully complete the line following challenge. You should anticipate that the final process of integrating and testing your solution will take a significant amount of time - therefore, do not leave the entire coursework until the deadline to do.

It is advised that you first read through all labsheets before you begin working with them.

## Supplementary Labsheets

The following labsheets provide further information on using other peripheral avaiable on your Romi.  You should not need the supplementary labsheets to complete Assessment 1 to a high standard.  These labsheets may be beneficial for Assessment 2, depending on the experiment your group decides to design.

## Acknowledgements

These materials were originally developed and tested by both Dr. Martin Garrad and Dr. Paul O'Dowd in 2018.  The materials have been iteratively updated by Paul in the years since.  We are grateful for the valuable feedback from students and teaching assistants.  We have typically provisioned and delivered this unit of study to 160 simultaneous students - this wouldn't be possible without a great team and community.  We are grateful to: the support, valuable input and critique from Prof. Arthur Richards & Prof. Seth Bullock; the support from school manager Evan Roberts; the always patient and friendly support of administrator Ann Foster; the patience of Emma Giddings in timetabling; support from the faculty of engineering technical services, including Jude Bramton, Dominic Hardman, Daryl White and Christopher Cooper.  Apologies to anyone I may have missed! (email me!)
