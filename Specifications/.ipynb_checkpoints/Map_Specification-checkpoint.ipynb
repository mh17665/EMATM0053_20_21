    "### General Rules:\n",
    "1. All straight line segments must be a minimum of 20cm long.  \n",
    "2. Your  map must not have any lines of symmetry (e.g., the map cannot be the same route when travelled forwards and backwards).  \n",
    "3. You may add further line segments to best make use of the physical space available to you.\n",
    "4. You cannot reduce line segments to 0cm, to bunch up components A,B,C,D (see map examples below).\n",
    "5. When combining map components (A, B, C, D), you may reduce joining straight line segments down to a minimum of 20cm length.\n",
    "6. All map components must be placed ahead of the `Starting Area`.  No map components may go behind a starting area.\n",
    "7. The line directly in front of the starting area must be at 90 degrees (perpendicular) to the direction of travel out of the starting area.  \n",
    "8. The line directly in front of the starting area must be a minimum of 10cm away from the end of the starting area.\n",
    "9. You must place a second starting area at the opposite end of your line, such that your Romi can attempt the course back in the other direction.\n",
    "10. Starting areas must each be placed at the start / terminus of the line, and not somewhere along the lines middle length.\n",
    "11. Your second start area must be placed at the other line terminus, e.g., they cannot both lead the Romi onto the same starting point of the line map.  \n",
    "12. You may add more than components A, B, C, & D to your map, and create your own challenges if you wish.  This will not secure you extra marks, and should be taken as a matter of interest or convenience.\n",
    "13. You are not able to secure any further marks or lenience in assessment by creating a line which is more difficult than necessary.\n",
    "14. If you have any doubt or concern you should contact a member of teaching staff.  There will be no lenience in assessment to compensate for negligence.  \n",

    "You must construct two start area as illustrated above (not to scale), adhering to the following rules:\n",
    "- It must have a depth (measured internal to the lines) of a **minimum** of 30cm.  Shorter starting areas are not permitted.\n",
    "- It must have a width (measured internal to the lines) of a **maximum** of 18cm.  Wider starting areas are not permitted.\n",
    "- Your start box must end a mimumum of 10cm away from the line course itself.\n",

    "- You may have a line break larger than 4cm, but not smaller.\n",
