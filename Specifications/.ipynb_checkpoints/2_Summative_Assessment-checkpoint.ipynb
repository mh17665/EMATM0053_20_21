    "# EMATM0053: Coursework Specification\n",
    "\n",
    "EMATM0053 is assessed by 100% coursework.  The emphasis of this coursework is to prepare you to develop and conduct experiments with robotic systems, including how to report results.  The main mechanism of this unit is to give you direct, hands-on experience of these activties via <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project-based_learning\">project-based learning</a>.  You will be working with a <a href=\"https://www.pololu.com/blog/643/new-product-romi-32u4-control-board\">Pololu Romi mobile robot kit</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The coursework is split into two assessments:\n",
    "- **[Formative] Assessment 1 (individual basis):** You must program your Romi robot to autonomously follow a line marked out on the floor, adhering to the Assessment 1 Specification (below) and the <a href=\"https://github.com/paulodowd/EMATM0054_20_21/blob/master/Specifications/Map_Specification.ipynb\">Map Specification</a>.\n",
    "    - Deadline: UoB Week 18, Friday 12th March 2021, 4pm.  \n",
    "    - Submission of video and <a href=\"https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=MH_ksn3NTkql2rGM8aQVG-VYf_NwHsJJlDfANaYLGz1UOFZIUE9OTUs5S1A1Wk83VTAyMUI1TzBYUy4u\">online self-assessment declaration</a>, and your final version of code used to Blackboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[Summative (100%)] Assessment 2 (team basis):** Your group must produce a 6-page report which details a scientific experiment conducted with your Romi, adhering to the Assessment 2 Specification, detailed below.\n",
    "    - Deadline: UoB Week 24, Friday 14th May 2021, 4pm.\n",
    "    - Submission of 6-page report & code to Blackboard.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The above two componenets run across two consecutive 6-week study periods for Assessment 1 and Assessment 2 respectively.  Your study will be supported by contact time with staff in the form of 2-hour lab-sessions each week, optional 1hr drop-in support sessions, and via lectures/Q&A sessions provided online.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You should treat the 2-hour lab-session as valuable time to raise questions with staff and gain feedback on your progress.  **Do not attempt complete the coursework by only working  within each 2 hour lab-session** - use time away from staff to work independently.  It is encouraged that you discuss your progress with your peers and generally support each other.  However, Assessment 1 must be your own work.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This coursework has been designed so that after the first 6 weeks you will all have gained a good level of skill competency before progressing to Assessment 2.  \n",
